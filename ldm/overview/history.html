    <h2>In the beginning</h2>

    <p>
    Long ago, in the DOS years, disks were small.  There were no partitions and
    filesystems simply used the whole disk.  As disks became larger, this wasn't
    the most practical solution.  By dividing the disk into partitions, it
    improved flexibility.  The only exceptions, now, are removable media, e.g.
    floppies, Zip disks.
    </p>

    <p>
    Each partition could contain different filesystem and potentially a
    different operating system, and it's now common to dedicate a partition as
    swap space.  The partitions were each given a drive letter and effectively
    presented to the user as separate disks.
    </p>

    <img src="images/part1.png" width="682" height="78" alt="part1" />

    <p>
    The first attempts at partitioning were limited to just four primary
    partitions.  At the beginning of each disk, the partition table listed the
    location and size of each partition.  It also gave a type to each one,
    e.g.&nbsp;0x01&nbsp;FAT12, 0x04&nbsp;FAT16.
    </p>

    <p>
    It was quickly realised that four partitions wouldn't be enough, so the
    partition type was extended to include an extended type, 0x05.  This
    <q>partition</q> actually pointed to the locaction of another partition
    table.
    </p>

    <p>
    Here, the first partition table show the location of the first three
    partitions.  The last entry points to the second partition table, which give
    the locations of partition four, and the third partition table.  And so
    on...  By chaining partition tables together, the maxiumum number of
    partitions in only limited by disk space.
    </p>

    <h2>Windows NT</h2>

    <p>
    Windows NT adopted the DOS partitioning scheme and added some enterprise
    features.  NT's software RAID volume sets allowed the creation of striped,
    mirrored and RAID5 volumes.  This gave NT a more efficient use of disks and
    fault tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
    However, NT still had problems:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>The volume naming limited it to just 26 volumes (A:&nbsp;-&nbsp;Z:).</li>
      <li>Most changes to partitions still required a reboot to take effect.</li>
      <li>All the volume set information was in the registry, making it
          difficult to move a disk to another machine</li>
      <li>The partition table limits volumes to only 2TB.</li>
    </ul>

    <a name="win2k"></a>
    <h2>Windows 2000</h2>

    <p>
    When Windows 2000 came along, it introduced the Logical Disk Manager (LDM)
    and the ability to mount volumes over directories.  At a stroke this removed
    all the filesystem limitations of Windows NT.
    </p>

    <p>
    Volumes did not need to have a drive letter so there was no limit to their
    number; RAID information was stored on-disk, so moving disks between
    computers was a simpler job; almost all partition changes could be performed
    without the need to reboot the computer.
    </p>

    <p>
    Disks using the new partitioning scheme were named <q><b>Dynamic</b></q> and any
    disks still using the old DOS-style partitions were called <q><b>Basic</b></q>
    RAID Volumes can only be created using Dynamic Disks.
    </p>

    <img src="images/part_ldm.png" width="682" height="117" alt="part_ldm" />

    <p>
    The LDM keeps a journalled database in the last 1MB of the physical disk,
    hence the need for some free space when converting from a basic disk to a
    dynamic disk.  This way, if there is a power, or disk, failure, the LDM
    database can be rolled back to a consistant state.  Any volumes that were
    being manipulated at the time may be lost, but the database will survive.
    </p>

    <p>
    The LDM also has a concept of Disk Groups.  Each group member has a database
    containing a list of all partitions on all the disks in that group.  This
    means that if a disk is removed, it is simple to find out what is missing,
    and in the case of fault-tolerant volumes, rebuild them on a new disk.
    Windows 2000 and XP only have one Disk Group.  It is called named after the
    machine is was created on, with <q>Dg0</q> as a suffix, e.g.  HomeDg0.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition, the NTFS driver changed to allow dynamic resizing.  This meant
    that an active volume, even stripes, mirrors, or RAID5, could be extended to
    use some free space on any disk.  There was no need to reboot, nor even
    close applications.

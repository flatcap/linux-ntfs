    <h2>Layout of Disk</h2>

    <p>
    Just after the dummy partition table, there is the first LDM structure.
    The Private Header (PRIVHEAD) is a table of accounting information.  It
    contains a version number, a unique GUID for the disk and the location of
    each of the other LDM structures.  If this structure is missing or damaged,
    then there are two backup copies.
    </p>

    <p>
    The LDM structures don't seem to vary in size, but the Private Header is the
    definitive reference.  The LDM database takes up the last 1MiB of the
    physical disk, which is why you need a small amount of space to upgrade to a
    dynamic disk.  If the disk is reverted to being a basic disk, then all
    traces of the LDM database is removed.
    </p>

    <h2>Layout of LDM</h2>

    <img src="images/database.png" width="682" height="118" alt="database" />

    <p>
    The PRIVHEAD gives the location and size of the database.  The first
    structure in the LDM is a Table of Contents (TOCBLOCK).  This lists which
    high-level we can expect.  At the moment there are only two: the
    <q>config</q> section which contains the actual database of partitions and
    volumes; the <q>log</q> section contains a journal of changes to the
    database.  There are four copies of the TOCBLOCK, but they seem to be
    identical at all times.
    </p>

    <p>
    The config section contains a VMDB and many VBLKs.  Each VBLK represents a
    disk group, disk, partition, component (container) or volume.
    </p>

    <p>
    The Journal (KLOG) is just an index of changes to the database.  The actual
    pending changes are kept in the main database.
    </p>

    <a name="vblkname"></a>
    <h2>VBLK Naming</h2>

    <p>
    Internally, each disk, partition, component and volume is given a unique
    name.  Disk groups are named after the machine, e.g. HomeDg0.  Disks are
    named Disk1, Disk2, etc.  The partitions for Disk1 are then called Disk1-01,
    Disk1-02, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    Striped volumes will be called Stripe1, Stripe2, etc<br>
    RAID volumes will be called Raid1, Raid2, etc<br>
    Simple, spanned and mirrored volumes will be called Volume1, Volume2, etc
    </p>

    <p>
    The component belonging the the volumes, above, will be called:
    Stripe1-01, Stripe1-02, Raid1-01, Raid1-02, Volume1-01, Volume1-02, etc
    </p>

    <p>
    When objects are deleted, new ones will take the lowest value of name
    available.
    </p>

    <h2>Example Volumes</h2>

    <p>
    Below are some example volumes.  The diagrams show which VBLKs will be
    present and how they are related.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Key:</b><br>
      <img src="images/key-v.png" width="75" height="30" alt="table key" />
      <img src="images/key-c.png" width="106" height="30" alt="table key" />
      <img src="images/key-p.png" width="79" height="30" alt="table key" />
      <img src="images/key-d.png" width="48" height="30" alt="table key" />
    </p>
    <br>

    <div>
    <img class="left" src="images/layout1.png" width="25" height="210" alt="vblk layout" />
    <p>
    <b>Simple Volume</b> The easiest example is the Simple Volume.  The
    filesystem takes up exactly one partition on one disk.
    </p>

    <p>
    If another partition is added to this volume type, then volume will be
    promoted to a Spanned Volume (below).
    </p>

    </div>
    <br class="clear">

    <img class="left" src="images/layout2.png" width="78" height="210" alt="vblk layout" />
    <p>
    <b>Mirrored Volume</b> This is easily identified.  The same volume information is
    sent to two components, partitions and disks.  The components don't alter
    the data at all.
    </p>

    <p>
    With two more partitions, it is possible to extend the volume.  The two
    components will have two children each, i.e. a Mirrored Spanned Volume (see
    below).
    </p>

    <p>
    Another partition could be added to this volume type, creating a third
    mirror section, giving the Volume a third child.
    </p>

    <br class="clear">

    <img class="left" src="images/layout3.png" width="77" height="210" alt="vblk layout" />
    <p>
    <b>Striped, RAID5, Spanned Volume</b> This is the most interesting layout.
    The component controls how the volume information is transformed before
    being sent to two or more partitions.
    </p>

    <p>
    With a Spanned Volume the partitions are joined together in a linear manner.
    The beginning of the filesystem is written to the first partition and the
    next part to the second partition, etc.
    </p>

    <p>
    For a striped volume, the filesystem is divided into chunks, usually 64kB.
    The first chunk is written to partition 1, the second to partition 2, for
    each partition, then it wraps around.
    </p>

    <p>
    A RAID5 volume usually has a chunk size of 16kB.  This type requires a
    minimun of three partitions.  For each set of chunks there is an additional
    chunk which contains parity information, which gives the volume fault
    tolerance.
    </p>

    <p>
    If another partition is added to any of these volumes, then the filesystem
    can be extended into it.  This will give the component more children.
    </p>

    <br class="clear">

    <img class="left" src="images/layout4.png" width="179" height="210" alt="vblk layout" />
    <p>
    <b>Mirrored Stripe, Mirrored Spanned Volume</b>  This shows how different
    ideas can be combined.  The volume information is written identically to two
    components which can either Stripe or Span the filesystem.
    </p>

    <p>
    These volumes can be extended, in two ways.  Adding another mirror would
    require two more partitions.  Extending the volume, would require four more
    partitions.

    overview of the log, too

    klog:
    fragged vblks have to be in order, since they have to be added
    (pending) in gaps in an atomic manner

    the sizes are variable, but give defaults, e.g. VBLK 128 bytes
    give overview of how sizes are range checked

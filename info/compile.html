    <p>
    Go to the <a href="../index.html">Linux NTFS Home Page</a>, the
    <a href="ntfs.html">NTFS FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)</a> or
    back to the <a href="index.html">Information Page</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you are a <b style="color: #f00;">RedHat user</b> and you simply want
    NTFS support, you now need only install an RPM to get it.  See our
    <a href="../rpm/index.html">RedHat Page</a> for more details.

    <h3>Compiling the Kernel</h3>

    <p>
    To do this you need to compile your own kernel.  This isn't as hard, or
    scary, as it sounds.  If you have problems after reading the help and the
    HOWTOs you can ask question on our
    help forum.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Get the source code</h3>

    <p>
    Your linux distribution should come with the kernel source.  It's probably a
    good idea to start with the same version as the kernel you are already
    running.
    </p>

    <p>
    These instructions are written using Linux 2.4 as a guide, but they should
    be almost the same for Linux 2.2.  This isn't a tutorial on how to build the
    Linux kernel, only on how to add NTFS support.
    </p>

    <p>
    In the source directory, in the file Documentation/Changes, there is a list
    of the <q>Current Minimal Requirements</q> to compile and run Linux.  If you
    are upgrading to a new version, it might be wise to check these.
    </p>

    <p>
    The latest kernel source code is available from:
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/">http://www.kernel.org</a>
    At the time of writing, the latest stable kernel is 2.4.18 and it
    can be found at:
    <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/">http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.4/</a>
    </p>

    <h3>2. Compile the source code</h3>

    <p>
    Many linux distributions will help you start the next job.  The key to
    building the kernel is the <q>.config</q>.  The kernel is very modular and
    you only build what you need to run.
    </p>

    <p>
    There's a HOWTO explaining how to configure and build the kernel. It lives
    at:
    http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html

    </p><p>
    If you are lucky, your distro left a copy of the .config for your kernel in
    the source directory.  If not, you will just have to think a bit more.
    </p>

    <p>
    Start with:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>make config</b>
    </pre>

    <p>
    You should be able to accept the defaults for a lot of the options.  For
    NTFS, choose either 'y' to build it into a kernel or 'm' to build a loadable
    module.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>N.B.</b> DO NOT enable write support for NTFS.  It isn't finished and is
    potentially very dangerous.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you make any mistakes, simply rerun the <q>make config</q> and try again.
    Each time you run it, it will remember all the values you typed last time
    and should be a bit quicker.
    </p>

    <p>
    Next:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>make dep</b>
    </pre>

    <p>
    If you want to just build some modules, do:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>make modules</b>
    </pre>

    <p>
    Otherwise:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>make bzImage modules</b>
    </pre>

    <h3>3.1 Install the modules</h3>

    <p>
    Now copy the modules into /lib/modules with:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>make modules_install</b>
    </pre>

    <h3>3.2 Install the kernel</h3>

    <p>
    This is complicated and depends on you bootloader.  Both lilo and grub come
    with detailed instructions.  Also there is help online at:
    </p>

    <p class="quote">
    http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/mini/LILO.html<br />
    http://www.gnu.org/software/grub/grub-documentation.en.html
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Reboot</h3>

    <p>
    If you are just building modules, ignore this section.
    </p>

    <p>
    Cross your fingers and reboot.  Good luck.  If everything went well then
    <q>uname -a</q>: should tell you about your new kernel.
    </p>

    <h3>3.4 Add modules</h3>

    <p>
    If you built NTFS into the kernel, not as a module, ignore this section.
    </p>

    <p>
    Now add the NTFS module to the running kernel:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>/sbin/modprobe ntfs</b>
    </pre>

    <h3>4. Mount</h3>

    <p>
    First try this command and check that <q>ntfs</q> is listed:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>cat /proc/filesystems</b>
    </pre>

    <p>
    Then:
    </p>

    <pre class="command">    <b>mount /dev/hda1 /mnt/windows -t ntfs -r</b>
    </pre>
